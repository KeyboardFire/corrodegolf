# corrodegolf

**corrodegolf** is a project with the purpose of solving challenges on
[Programming Puzzles & Code Golf Stack Exchange](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)
with robust, idiomatic, and readable Rust code. Its secondary purpose is to
make use of the terrible pun "corrodegolf," a combination of the words
"corrode" (i.e. Rust) and "codegolf."

To provide further context: the typical code golf solution is an unreadable and
inefficient mess, as the goal of code golf is to find the solution with the
fewest number of bytes. That means: no whitespace, one-character variable
names, etc.

corrodegolf was inspired by the following two chat messages in PPCG chat:
